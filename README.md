# Diffusion-Equations-Landmines-Detection
The intention is to create models that replicate the changes in temperature triggered by the presence of landmines underground, to detect them more accurately. The aim is to develop a mathematical model that can effectively imitate the thermal fluctuations generated by buried landmines, thus helping to facilitate their detection.
